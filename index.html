                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">The internet has such a pervasive effect on our lives that it is hard to imagine living without it. People use it as a tool, a companion, a vehicle for communication, a space for self-reflection, and an entertainment platform. As a result, we now begin to speak of post-internet because the internet has become so ubiquitous that we stop to notice its existence. <br><br>This online exhibition looks at how artists use the internet as a medium and a subject of criticism and artistic reflection. Especially during phenomenal times like these, online spaces are more important than ever because they provide makers and galleries alike with ways to connect with their audience, to help each other, listen, collaborate and heal.<br><br>Everything You See Is In The Past is part of a research project by University of Greenwich student Francesco Imola which looks at what concerns the internet brings to artists and curators. It also provides an opportunity to consider and analyse some of the changes that have occurred to curatorial practice in the 21st century thanks to the internet and digital culture.<br><br>Artists: Atom Chen / Dario Bucheli / Enes Alba / Francesco Imola / Perce Jerrom<br>Curated by: Francesco Imola, BA Digital Arts University of Greenwich, 2020<br><br><strong>Exhibition opens 28 March 2020 - 11 April</strong><br><br>Join us on Zoom tonight, 28 March, 8:30 - 10PM, for a virtual happy hour and private view of the exhibition. This virtual meeting, titled <em>ANIMAL_HUMAN_INTERFACE:&nbsp;Come hang out while observing social distancing</em>, is both Francesco Imola's performance piece as part of the exhibition and a space for anyone to socialise and find refuge in art as best as possible while staying home.&nbsp;Participants will receive a tour of the exhibition, will visit other virtual museums and collections, and enjoy the evening together. All from the comfort of your couch or bed. Head <a href="http://linktr.ee/everythingyousee" target="_blank">here</a> to join*.<br></p>
